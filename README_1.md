# churn_prediction

## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for many industries, where businesses lose clients to competitors or dissatisfaction. This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict customer churn, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures.

## The project workflow involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding key relationships between features and churn.

Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset with new features.

Modeling: Training several machine learning models.

Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using various metrics.

Insights and Interpretation: Understanding the key drivers of churn based on model results.


## Techniques Used
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps revealed patterns in customer behavior, such as:
Higher churn rates for customers with month-to-month contracts.
A strong correlation between high monthly charges and churn.

 Feature Engineering
New Features: Created tenure categories to help capture the effect of customer loyalty.
One-hot Encoding: Categorical features like contract type, payment method, and internet service were converted into numerical values for model input.
Scaling: Numerical features such as monthly charges were scaled to improve model performance

Modeling
Several machine learning models were applied:

Logistic Regression

SVM

Decision Tree

Random Forest

KNN







Contract Type: Customers with month-to-month contracts were far more likely to churn.

Monthly Charges: Higher monthly charges led to increased churn likelihood.

Customer Tenure: Newer customers had a higher chance of churning.

Paperless Billing: Slightly higher churn was seen among customers using paperless billing, possibly due to less frequent interaction with the company.
